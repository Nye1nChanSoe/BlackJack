## Rules of Blackjack

Blackjack is a popular card game typically played between one or more players and a dealer. The goal of the game is to have a hand with a value as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding 21.

### Card Values

- **Number cards (2-10)**: Their face value (e.g., a 5 of Hearts is worth 5 points).
- **Face cards (J, Q, K)**: Each is worth 10 points.
- **Aces (A)**: Can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever benefits the player most.
- **Suits (♠, ♥, ♦, ♣)** have no impact on the card’s value or ranking in Blackjack.
- The value of a card depends solely on its rank, not its suit.
